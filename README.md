# CNT-graphene
In this work, a pathfinding algorithm is used to exhaust all possible configurations on graphene to seamlessly connect to a given CNT. The least squares approach method follows to sort out the configuration with minimum energy. The combined methods are able to generate CNT/graphene junction for any CNT type (m, n). Molecular dynamics simulation further reveals that the formed junctions are thermodynamically stable, and thus ready to serve as basic block for a CNT/graphene network.
By providing an easy-to-use numerical tool in the form of MATLAB code, the intention is to free material scientists from the tedious preparation of atomic configuration.
